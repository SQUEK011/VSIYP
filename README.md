<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

VSIYP is a video processing application based on Android, with the intention of creating a good UI/UX design, so that users will be able to quickly do special image or video processing features. Utlizing the Huawei Video Editor Kit SDK, the app will allow users to preview a live camera feed of the smartphoneâ€™s built-in camera, take a snap-shot photo or short video clip, perform image processing, photo or video editing features with the 27 video processing tools provided, before saving or sharing the final photo/video through social networks via WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, etc. 
VSIYP has 27 different video processing tools that can be categorized into 3 different categories: 
1. Common Processing Tools
2. Special Effect Tools
3. AI-powered tools

These tools will definitely allow you as a content creator to process your videos quickly and conveniently so that you can upload to social media and be part of the trends~
